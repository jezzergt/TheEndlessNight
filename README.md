# TheEndlessNight

**Endless Night was my submission for the 2023 Pixel Art Game Jam. This project was completed in a little over 5 days. The theme for this Game Jam is Mystery, so we have decided to do a fantasy, 2d, side-scroller in unity. The game includes story-telling, adventure and secrets to be revealed.**
